    """Configuration for protein diversity constraint.

    This class defines configuration parameters for evaluating amino acid diversity
    in protein sequences. The constraint measures how many different amino acid
    types are present in the sequence and penalizes sequences with insufficient
    diversity, which may indicate poor protein quality, repetitive sequences, or
    non-functional proteins.

    Attributes:
        min_diversity (float): Minimum acceptable amino acid diversity (0.0-1.0).
            Calculated as (unique amino acids) / 20, where 20 is the total number
            of standard amino acids. For example, 0.5 means at least 10 different
            amino acid types must be present. Typical values range from 0.6 (12
            amino acids, lenient) to 0.9 (18 amino acids, strict). Higher values
            enforce more diverse amino acid usage. Default: 0.7.

    Note:
        A diversity score of 1.0 means all 20 standard amino acids are present,
        while 0.0 means only one amino acid type is used (homopolymer).

    """Evaluate amino acid diversity in protein sequences.

    This constraint function measures the diversity of amino acid types present
    in protein sequences. It calculates diversity as the fraction of the 20
    standard amino acids that appear in the sequence, and penalizes sequences
    that fall below a minimum diversity threshold. The penalty scales linearly
    with the deficit below the minimum diversity threshold.

    Args:
        input_sequences (list[tuple[Sequence, ...]]): List of sequence tuples to evaluate.
            Each tuple contains one protein sequence.

        config (ProteinDiversityConfig): Configuration object containing
            ``min_diversity`` (minimum acceptable amino acid diversity, default: 0.5).

    Returns:
        list[ConstraintOutput]: One result per sequence. A score of 0.0 indicates
            sufficient diversity (diversity at or above threshold) and higher
            values indicate insufficient amino acid diversity. Scores scale
            linearly with the deficit below the threshold (e.g., if min_diversity
            is 0.5 and actual diversity is 0.25, the score is 0.5), capped at 1.0.
            ``metadata`` carries:

            - ``aa_diversity_score``: Float diversity score (0.0-1.0) calculated as
              (unique amino acids) / 20
            - ``unique_amino_acid_count``: Integer count of unique amino acid types
              present in the sequence (0-20)
            - ``unique_amino_acids``: Sorted list of amino acid characters present
              in the sequence

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If any sequence in the input list is not a protein sequence.
        ValueError: If any sequence has length 0 (empty sequence).

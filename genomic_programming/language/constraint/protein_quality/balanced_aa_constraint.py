    """Configuration for balanced amino acid constraint.
    
    This class defines configuration parameters for evaluating whether a protein
    sequence has balanced representation of all amino acid types. The constraint
    penalizes sequences that have too many underrepresented amino acids (those
    appearing below a minimum frequency threshold). The penalty score increases
    both with the number of underrepresented amino acids beyond the threshold and
    with the severity of under-representation (how far below min_aa_frequency each
    amino acid falls).
    
    Attributes:
        min_aa_frequency (float): Minimum acceptable relative frequency for any
            amino acid type in the sequence. For example, 0.02 means each amino
            acid should appear at least 2% of the time in the sequence. Valid
            range is 0.0 to 1.0. Typical values range from 0.01 (1%, lenient)
            to 0.05 (5%, strict). Default: 0.02.

        max_underrepresented_count (int): Maximum acceptable number of amino acid
            types that can be underrepresented (below ``min_aa_frequency``) before
            the sequence is penalized. Valid range is 0 to 20 (total number of
            standard amino acids). For example, if set to 3, sequences with 4 or
            more underrepresented amino acids will receive a penalty score. Lower
            values enforce stricter amino acid diversity requirements. Default: 3.

    """Evaluate the presence of underrepresented amino acids in protein sequences.
    
    This constraint function assesses whether protein sequences have balanced
    representation of all amino acid types by identifying amino acids that appear
    below a minimum frequency threshold and penalizing sequences that have too many
    such underrepresented amino acids. The penalty is scaled based on both the
    number of excess underrepresented amino acids and the severity of their
    under-representation.
    
    For each input sequence, it calculates amino acid frequencies, identifies
    underrepresented amino acids, and computes a penalty score if the number
    of underrepresented amino acids exceeds the configured threshold.
    
    Args:
        sequences (List[Sequence]): List of protein sequences to evaluate. All
            sequences must have ``sequence_type == SequenceType.PROTEIN``.
            
        config (BalancedAaConfig): Configuration object containing ``min_aa_frequency``
            (minimum acceptable relative frequency, default: 0.02) and
            ``max_underrepresented_count`` (maximum acceptable number of
            underrepresented amino acid types, default: 3).
    
    Returns:
        List[float]: Constraint scores for each sequence, ranging from 0.0 (best,
            acceptable number of underrepresented amino acids) to 1.0 (worst,
            many severely underrepresented amino acids). The score is scaled based
            on how many excess underrepresented amino acids there are beyond the
            threshold and how far below the minimum frequency they fall.
    
    Raises:
        AssertionError: If any sequence in the input list is not a protein sequence.
    
    Note:
        This function modifies the input sequences by adding metadata to each
        ``Sequence`` object's ``_metadata`` dictionary with the following keys:

        - ``underrepresented_aa_score``: Float score indicating overall
          underrepresentation severity
        - ``amino_acid_counts``: Dictionary mapping amino acids to their counts
        - ``underrepresented_amino_acids``: List of amino acids that
          are underrepresented
        - ``underrepresented_aa_count``: Integer count of underrepresented amino
          acid types
        - ``min_aa_frequency_threshold``: The minimum frequency threshold used

    Score one or more DNA Sequences against motifs using MEME.

    Modified scoring:
    - Unwanted motifs: Strong matches (low e-value) get high penalties
    - Wanted motifs: Strong matches (low e-value) get LOW penalties (rewards)

    Aggregation strategies for handling many motifs:
    - "smart": Uses max/percentile for unwanted, average for wanted
    - "average": Simple average of all penalties
    - "max": Takes maximum penalty
    - "percentile": Uses specified percentile of penalties

    Args:
        sequences: Sequence or list of sequences to evaluate
        motifs_path: Path to MEME motif file
        meme_bin_path: Path to MEME binaries
        wanted: Motifs that should be present
        not_wanted: Motifs that should not be present
        scale: Scaling factor for penalties
        exclusive: If True, automatically sets complement (e.g., one TF motif set for wanted, sets unwanted to all others)
        aggregation: Aggregation strategy to combine multiple penalties
        percentile_value: Which percentile to use (if aggregation="percentile", e.g., 5% takes penalties of top 5% of hits)
        unwanted_focus: Prioritize scoring of unwanted motifs

    Returns:
        float or list[float]: penalty scores (0=best, 1=worst).

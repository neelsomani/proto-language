    """Generator base class that modifies proposal_sequences of assigned segments during optimization.

    Mutation generators can operate on length-only segments by first seeding
    random starting sequences in ``_validate_generator``. That fallback provides
    initial proposal sequences for the mutation step.

    A generator may be assigned one segment or a tuple of "tied" segments that
    share the same generated value (e.g. protomers of a symmetric homo-oligomer).
    Subclasses implement ``_sample()`` writing to ``self.segment.proposal_sequences``;
    the public ``sample()`` orchestrator calls ``_sample()`` then mirrors those
    proposals to any tied segments via deepcopy.

    Subclasses must implement ``__init__()`` and ``_sample()``. Override
    ``assign()`` only to add extra validation (call ``super().assign()`` first).

    Attributes:
        batch_size (int): Number of sequences to generate per batch.

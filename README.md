<!--[![Docs](https://github.com/evo-design/proto-language/actions/workflows/docs.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/evo-design/proto-language/actions/workflows/docs.yml)-->

A framework for designing biological sequences (DNA, RNA, proteins) with constraint-based optimization.

## Installation 

To install create the `proto-language` conda environment and install the dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
bash install.sh
conda activate proto-language
```


## Running the API

### Local Development

```bash
python api/start_dev.py
```

### Docker

```bash
docker-compose up
```

API will be available at http://localhost:8000

## Tests

Tests can be run with various filtering options based on hardware utilization and execution time.  
See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for more details. A few commonly used commands are listed below.

- By default, slow tests *are skipped*. You must specify `--all` to run them.
- By default, we don't filter tests by hardware utilization. Specify `--cpu` to run only CPU-based tests and `--gpu` to run only GPU-based tests.

```bash
# Run all tests that are not marked as slow (both CPU and GPU based)
pytest

# Run all tests, including slow ones (both CPU and GPU based)
pytest --all

# Run fast CPU-based tests
pytest --cpu

# Run all GPU-based tests
pytest --gpu --all
```


## Running the Toy Example

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open and run `notebooks/toy_example.ipynb`

    This class defines configuration parameters for limiting homopolymer length
    in DNA, RNA, or protein sequences. Homopolymers are consecutive runs of the
    same nucleotide or amino acid (e.g., "AAAAA", "GGGGGG", "SSSSSS"). This constraint
    uses logarithmic scaling for penalties to avoid extreme values while still penalizing
    very long homopolymers, providing moderate penalties for slightly exceeding the limit 
    and strong penalties for greatly exceeding the limit.

    Attributes:
        max_length (int): Maximum allowed homopolymer length in consecutive identical
            nucleotides or amino acids. Must be a positive integer. Sequences with
            homopolymers longer than this value are penalized. Typical values depend
            on application, with some examples provided below:
            - DNA synthesis: 8-10 (avoid synthesis errors)
            - PCR primers: 5-8 (prevent polymerase slippage)
            - Protein sequences: 5+ (avoid excessive amino acid repeats)

    """Penalize sequences containing homopolymers longer than specified maximum
    
    This constraint function identifies the longest homopolymer (consecutive run
    of identical nucleotides or amino acids) in each sequence and penalizes
    sequences where this exceeds a specified maximum length.
    
    The penalty uses logarithmic scaling to provide graduated penalties: sequences
    slightly over the limit receive moderate penalties, while sequences far
    exceeding the limit receive strong penalties (capped at 1.0). This avoids
    extreme penalty values while still strongly discouraging very long homopolymers.

    Args:
        input_sequences (List[Tuple[Sequence, ...]]): List of sequence tuples to evaluate.
            Each tuple contains one DNA, RNA, or protein sequence.

        config (MaxHomopolymerConfig): Configuration object containing ``max_length``
            (maximum allowed homopolymer length).

    Returns:
        List[float]: Constraint scores for each sequence. A score of 0.0 indicates
            no homopolymers exceed the maximum length (pass). Higher scores indicate
            longer homopolymers with logarithmic scaling.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the input list is empty.
    
    Note:
        This function modifies the input sequences by adding metadata to each
        ``Sequence`` object's ``_metadata`` dictionary with the following key:
        
        - ``max_homopolymer_length``: Integer length of the longest homopolymer
          found in the sequence. For example, "ATCGAAAAAGTC" would have value 5
          (for the "AAAAA" run).

class Optimizer(ABC):
    """
    Base class for optimization algorithms.

    Coordinates multiple generators and constraints to search for optimal
    biological sequences through iterative optimization. Unlike generators
    which modify sequences directly, optimizers orchestrate the search process
    by coordinating generators, evaluating constraints, and making decisions
    about which sequences to keep.

    Pool Initialization:
        ``_initialize_sequence_pools()`` is called during ``__init__()`` and by
        ``Program.run_stage()`` before each subsequent optimizer. It reads from
        ``selected_sequences`` (from previous optimizer) or ``original_sequence``
        and initializes both pools by cycling through source to preserve diversity.

    Filter Constraints:
        Constraints with a threshold parameter act as binary filters that accept or reject
        candidates before scoring. Rejected candidates receive infinite penalty scores
        and skip all subsequent constraint evaluations, improving performance when
        constraints are computationally expensive.

        Filter evaluation order:
        1. All filter constraints (those with threshold set) are evaluated first
        2. Candidates must pass ALL filters (AND logic)
        3. Only accepted candidates are evaluated by scoring constraints
        4. Rejected candidates receive filter_penalty score (default: inf)

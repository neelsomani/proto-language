    """Configuration object for TopKOptimizer.

    This class defines configuration parameters for the TopK optimizer, which
    generates many candidate sequences and retains only the best K by lowest energy
    score.

    Attributes:
        min_num_samples (int): Minimum number of total samples to generate across
            all rounds. Must be divisible by ``batch_size`` to ensure equal-sized
            batches. If ``energy_threshold`` is set, may generate additional samples
            beyond this minimum until threshold is met. Must be at least 1.

        k (int): Number of top sequences to keep and return based on energy scores.
            Must be at least 1 and cannot exceed ``min_num_samples``. Lower energy
            scores are better (minimization objective). Must be at least 1.

        batch_size (int): Number of samples to generate per round. Enables batching
            for efficient parallel generation. Total rounds equals
            ``min_num_samples / batch_size``. Must be at least 1 and must evenly
            divide ``min_num_samples``.

        energy_threshold (Optional[float]): Optional threshold for early stopping.
            If set, continues sampling beyond ``min_num_samples`` until the worst
            energy in top-K is below this threshold, up to ``max_num_samples`` total.
            If ``None``, generates exactly ``min_num_samples``. Must be at least 0
            if provided. Default: ``None``.

        max_num_samples (Optional[int]): Maximum number of samples to generate when
            using threshold-based stopping. Prevents infinite sampling if threshold
            is never met. Must be divisible by ``batch_size`` and at least
            ``min_num_samples``. If ``None`` and ``energy_threshold`` is set,
            defaults to ``min_num_samples x 10``. Default: ``None``.

        verbose (bool): Whether to print detailed progress information including
            round statistics, energy values, and threshold status. Default: ``False``.

    Note:
        The optimizer generates samples in rounds of size ``batch_size``. For
        threshold-based stopping to work, both ``energy_threshold`` and
        ``max_num_samples`` must be set. All sampling parameters must be divisible
        by ``batch_size`` to ensure consistent batching.

class TopKOptimizer(Optimizer):
    """TopK optimizer for sequence optimization through extensive sampling.

    This optimizer generates many candidate sequences through multiple sampling
    rounds and maintains only the top-K sequences by energy score. Unlike iterative
    optimizers (MCMC, beam search), it does not maintain state between rounds—each
    round starts fresh from original sequences.

    In each round, the optimizer generates ``batch_size`` candidates, applies all
    generators sequentially to them, evaluates them with constraints, and updates
    the top-K list if any candidates are better than the current worst in top-K.
    This continues for ``min_num_samples / batch_size`` rounds, and optionally
    continues until an energy threshold is met or ``max_num_samples`` is reached.

    Attributes:
        min_num_samples (int): Minimum total samples to generate.
        batch_size (int): Samples per round (enables batching).
        k (int): Number of top sequences to keep.
        rounds (int): Number of rounds (``min_num_samples / batch_size``).
        energy_threshold (Optional[float]): Optional threshold for early stopping.
        max_num_samples (Optional[int]): Maximum samples with threshold stopping.
        top_k_heap (List[tuple]): Max-heap tracking top-K candidates.

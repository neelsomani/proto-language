The package is now structured with `pyproject.toml`. Install with:

1. Create the conda environment:
```bash
conda create --name proto-language python=3.12 -y
conda activate proto-language
conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda mmseqs2 -y
```

2. Install as an editable package:

    A) Only with CPU dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install uv
    uv pip install -e .
    ```

    B) Or with GPU dependencies:
    ```bash

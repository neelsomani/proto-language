class ProteinRepetitivenessConfig(BaseConfig):
    """Configuration for protein repetitiveness constraint.

    This class defines configuration parameters for evaluating repetitive content
    in protein sequences using k-mer frequency analysis. The constraint detects
    and penalizes sequences with excessive tandem repeats or repetitive motifs,
    which may indicate low-complexity regions or non-functional proteins. The
    repetitiveness score is calculated as the maximum fraction of the sequence
    covered by any repeated k-mer. For example, if "AAA" appears 10 times in a
    100-amino-acid sequence, the repetitiveness for 3-mers is (10 * 3) / 100 = 0.3
    (30% of sequence).

    Attributes:
        max_repetitiveness (float): Maximum acceptable repetitiveness fraction
            (0.0-1.0). Measures the maximum fraction of the sequence covered by
            repeated k-mers. For example, 0.3 means at most 30% of the sequence
            can consist of repeated motifs. Typical values range from 0.05 (strict,
            allows up to 5% repetitive content) to 0.3 (lenient, allows up to 30%).
            Lower values enforce less repetitive sequences. Default: 0.1.

        min_repeat_length (int): Minimum k-mer length to consider as repeats.
            Must be a positive integer. Smaller values detect most typical sequence
            repeats like "ATATATATA" or "MLKVMLKV", while longer values (5-7) detect larger
            structural repeats or large motif duplications. The algorithm checks k-mers
            from this length up to ``min_repeat_length + 7`` to find the most
            repetitive pattern. Default: 1.

    """Evaluate protein sequence repetitiveness based on k-mer frequency analysis.

    This constraint function analyzes protein sequences for repetitive content by
    examining k-mer frequencies. It identifies sequences with excessive repetitive motifs,
    which may indicate low-complexity regions or non-functional proteins. The analysis
    scans multiple k-mer lengths to detect both short tandem repeats and larger sequence
    duplications. The repetitiveness score represents the maximum fraction of the sequence
    covered by any repeated k-mer. For example, if "SSS" appears 8 times in a
    60-amino-acid sequence, the repetitiveness for 3-mers is (8 * 3) / 60 = 0.4
    (40% of sequence).

    Args:
        input_sequences (list[tuple[Sequence, ...]]): List of sequence tuples to evaluate.
            Each tuple contains one protein sequence.

        config (ProteinRepetitivenessConfig): Configuration object containing
            ``max_repetitiveness`` (maximum acceptable repetitiveness fraction,
            default: 0.4) and ``min_repeat_length`` (minimum k-mer length to
            consider, default: 3).

    Returns:
        List[float]: Constraint scores for each sequence, where 0.0 indicates
            acceptable repetitiveness (at or below threshold) and higher values
            indicate excessive repetitive content. Penalties scale linearly with
            excess repetitiveness: if max is 0.4 and actual is 0.6, the excess
            (0.2) is normalized by the remaining range (1.0 - 0.4 = 0.6), giving
            a score of 0.33.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If any sequence in the input list is not a protein sequence.

    Note:
        This function modifies the input sequences by adding metadata to each
        ``Sequence`` object's ``_metadata`` dictionary with the following keys:

        - ``repetitiveness_score``: Float repetitiveness score (0.0-1.0)
          representing the maximum fraction of sequence covered by repeated k-mers
        - ``max_repetitive_fraction``: Float identical to ``repetitiveness_score``
          (kept for backward compatibility)

class BeamSearchGenerator(IterativeGenerator):
    """
    Beam search generator that processes segments sequentially with context accumulation.
    
    This generator implements a sequential beam search where:
    1. Segments are processed one at a time, in order
    2. For each segment, the top K sequences accumulated from previous segments are used as prompts
    3. Generators are applied sequentially within each segment to generate num_candidates
    4. Constraints are evaluated on concatenated sequences after each segment
    5. Top K combinations are selected and used as prompts for the next segment
    
    **Key Features:**
    - Processes segments sequentially (not independently)
    - Accumulates context from previous segments as prompts
    - Applies constraints after each segment to guide optimization
    - Maintains beam search across segment boundaries
    - Freezes optimization of earlier segments as new segments are added
    
    **Important: Generator Batch Size Override**
    - Generator `batch_size` parameters are ignored during beam search
    - The `beam_width` parameter controls how many sequences are maintained (K)
    - The `num_candidates` parameter controls how many candidates are generated per beam (N)
    - Generators are applied to individual sequences, not batches

    Args:
        generators: List of Generator objects for sequence modification
        constraints: List of Constraint objects for evaluation
        constructs: List containing exactly one Construct object to optimize
        constraint_weights: Optional weights for constraints
        beam_width: Number of candidates to maintain per sequence (K). This overrides
                   any `batch_size` parameters of individual generators.
        num_candidates: Number of candidates to generate per beam candidate (N)
        temperature: Temperature for candidate generation (default: 1.0)
        verbose: Whether to print progress information
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If no constructs are provided or if more than one construct is provided.

        Run sequential beam search across all segments with context accumulation.
        
        This method implements the core beam search algorithm by processing segments
        sequentially and maintaining beams of the most promising sequence combinations.
        
        **Beam Search Process:**
        1. For each segment, use accumulated sequences from previous segments as prompts
        2. Generate candidates for the current segment using these prompts
        3. Create combinations by pairing new candidates with sequences from previous segments
        4. Evaluate constraints on concatenated sequences to compute energy scores
        5. Select top-K combinations (lowest energy) to maintain in the beam
        6. Use these combinations as prompts for the next segment
        7. Continue until all segments are processed
        
        **Combination Management:**
        - Combinations are dictionaries mapping segment indices to Sequence objects
        - Each combination represents a complete path through the sequence space
        - The beam maintains K such combinations, where K = beam_width
        - Combinations are evaluated by concatenating sequences and applying constraints
        - Only the best K combinations (lowest energy scores) are kept for the next iteration
        
        Returns:
            List containing the construct with updated beam candidates, where each
            segment maintains exactly beam_width sequences representing the best
            combinations found during the search.

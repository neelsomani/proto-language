    """Configuration for SpliceTransformer tissue-specific splicing constraint.
    
    This class defines configuration parameters for evaluating tissue-specific
    splicing patterns using SpliceTransformer, a deep learning model trained to
    predict splice site usage across different human tissues. The constraint can
    be used to either maximize splicing in a specific tissue (tissue-specific
    activation) or minimize it (tissue-specific repression), enabling design of
    sequences with controlled tissue-specific alternative splicing.
    
    Attributes:
        left_context (str): DNA sequence providing left (5') context for
            SpliceTransformer prediction. Must be exactly 4000 bp (CONTEXT_LENGTH).
            This flanking sequence provides upstream genomic context that influences
            tissue-specific splice site recognition. Should be the genomic sequence
            immediately 5' of the target sequence.

        right_context (str): DNA sequence providing right (3') context for
            SpliceTransformer prediction. Must be exactly 4000 bp (CONTEXT_LENGTH).
            This flanking sequence provides downstream genomic context. Should be
            the genomic sequence immediately 3' of the target sequence.

        splice_pos (List[int]): Zero-indexed position(s) within the input
            sequence to evaluate for tissue-specific splicing. These positions
            typically correspond to splice sites (donor or acceptor) where you
            want to assess or control tissue-specific usage. Can be a single
            integer (automatically converted to list) or list of integers for
            multiple positions.

        tissue (SpliceTransformerTissue): Target tissue for specificity evaluation.
            Options include "AVERAGE" (average across all tissues, default) or
            specific tissues like "BRAIN", "HEART", "LIVER", "MUSCLE", "TESTIS",
            etc. SpliceTransformer was trained on RNA-seq data from multiple human
            tissues and can predict tissue-specific splicing patterns. Use "AVERAGE"
            for general splice site quality or specific tissues for tissue-specific
            designs. Default: "AVERAGE".

        direction (Literal["max", "min"]): Optimization direction for the splice
            score. Use "max" to maximize splicing at the position (encourage splice
            site usage), or "min" to minimize splicing (discourage splice site usage).
            For example, use "max" to create tissue-specific splice sites that are
            active in the target tissue, or "min" to create sites that are silenced
            in the target tissue. Default: "max".

        splice_transformer_config (SpliceTransformerConfig): Advanced SpliceTransformer
            configuration including context length, device settings, and model
            parameters. Default: SpliceTransformerConfig().

    """Evaluate tissue-specific splicing with SpliceTransformer.
    
    This constraint function uses SpliceTransformer to predict tissue-specific
    splice site usage at specified positions in DNA sequences. The model was
    trained on GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression) RNA-seq data from multiple human
    tissues and can predict how strongly a splice site will be used in different tissue
    contexts.
    
    The constraint enables design of sequences with controlled tissue-specific
    alternative splicing, such as brain-specific exon inclusion or liver-specific
    exon skipping. By setting the direction parameter, you can either maximize
    splicing in a target tissue (for tissue-specific activation) or minimize it
    (for tissue-specific repression).
    
    The function requires precisely sized inputs: the target sequence must be
    exactly 1000 bp, and both flanking contexts must be exactly 4000 bp each,
    for a total analyzed region of 9000 bp.

    Args:
        input_sequences (List[Tuple[Sequence, ...]]): List of sequence tuples to evaluate.
            Each tuple contains one DNA sequence. Must be exactly 1000 bp in length.
            This is the central region containing the positions to be evaluated for
            tissue-specific splicing.
            
        config (SpliceTransformerSpecificityConfig): Configuration object containing
            ``left_context`` (4000 bp), ``right_context`` (4000 bp), ``splice_pos``
            (position(s) to evaluate), ``tissue`` (target tissue, default: "AVERAGE"),
            ``direction`` (optimization direction, default: "max"), and optional
            ``splice_transformer_config`` for advanced settings.

    Returns:
        List[float]: Constraint scores ranging from 0.0 to 1.0 for each sequence.
            The interpretation depends on the ``direction`` parameter:
            
            - **direction="max"** (maximize splicing): Score = 1.0 - tissue_probability.
              Lower scores indicate stronger predicted splicing (0.0 = 100% probability,
              1.0 = 0% probability). Use this to encourage tissue-specific splice
              site usage.
            - **direction="min"** (minimize splicing): Score = tissue_probability.
              Lower scores indicate weaker predicted splicing (0.0 = 0% probability,
              1.0 = 100% probability). Use this to discourage tissue-specific splice
              site usage.
            
            When multiple positions are specified, the score uses the mean probability
            across all positions.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If left_context and right_context lengths don't match, or
            if the output shape doesn't match the input sequence length.
        ValueError: If direction is not "max" or "min".
    
    Note:
        This function modifies the input sequence by adding metadata to the
        ``Sequence`` object's ``_metadata`` dictionary with the following keys:
        
        - ``specificity_direction_{tissue}``: String indicating the optimization
          direction used ("max" or "min")
        - ``specificity_score_{tissue}``: Float constraint score for the specified
          tissue
        
        The metadata keys include the tissue name, so evaluating multiple tissues
        on the same sequence will create separate metadata entries for each.
    
    Examples:

        >>> left_ctx = "ATCG" * 1000

        >>> print(target_seq._metadata["specificity_direction_BRAIN"])  # "max"

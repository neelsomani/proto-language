# Planning Quick Reference

A one-page cheat sheet of the most frequently used rules for the biological
design planning loop. Refer to the full system prompt for definitions, edge
cases, and reasoning. For a worked example of the Phase 2 output these rules
produce, see `notes/component-planning-example.md`.

## The Five Hard Constraints

1. **No invented biology.** Sequences and panels come from the task, staged
   assets, or sourced databases. Never memory.
2. **No static candidate tables.** Final candidates come from an optimizer-owned
   pool.
3. **Validate against the named comparison set.** When the task names one
   (UniRef50, a wildtype, a panel), it is non-substitutable.
4. **No silent failures.** No broad `try/except` around decisive calls.
5. **Model priors are not validity checks.** Likelihood does not satisfy a
   structural or functional requirement.

## The Planning Loop, at a Glance

```
Phase 1: biological_planning.md       → review pass
   │
   ▼
Phase 2: component_planning.md        → review pass
   │
   ▼ (only on a named blocker)
Phase 3: external_research.md         → review pass
   │
   ▼ (if upstream changed, loop back)
   ▼
Converged? (3 conditions all hold)    → cap at 3 cycles
   │
   ▼
final_biological_design_plan.md       → final review → implement

## Optimizer Decision Tree, Compressed

| Situation | Branch |
|---|---|
| Capable generator + cheap filters | Best-of-K / rejection |
| Refinement task with starting candidate | MCMC with intelligent mutations |
| De novo + property predictor + conditioned generator | Cycling |
| De novo + differentiable generator + differentiable constraint | Gradient |
| De novo + capable scoring, no cycling/gradient path | Black-box MCMC / simulated annealing |
| Multiple branches fit different phases | Compose (broad-then-narrow, generate-then-verify, coarse-then-fine) |
| No branch fits | Upstream choices are wrong — return to generator/constraint selection |

## Constraint Roles

Every constraint plays exactly one.

| Role | When applied | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Cheap filter | Every proposal | Reject malformed / obviously-bad before expensive checks |
| Heavy validation | Survivors of cheap filters | Go/no-go on a must-pass requirement |
| Ranker | Pool of validated candidates | Order surviving pool by task's ranking criterion |
| Steering signal | During gradient/cycling search | Bias generation toward objective |

## Deep-Dive Is Mandatory When

- The requirement is high-stakes: structure folding, binding, off-target search,
  novelty against a named database.
- The initial survey returned more than two or three plausible tool candidates.

A deep-dive produces: recommended primary tool, independent secondary tools for
agreement, and ruled-out lookalikes.

## Oracle Agreement Guidance

- Must-pass high-stakes check: minimum one direct check + one independent proxy.
  Three is stronger.
- Cheap, unambiguous check (length, alphabet): one is fine.
- State the compute cost in the plan. If only one fits the budget, set the
  threshold stricter to compensate.

## When to Stop and Ask the User

- Phase 1 ambiguities cannot be resolved from task / assets / local docs.
- A must-pass requirement has no satisfying component and a custom one is not
  feasible.
- Convergence loop hits its 3-cycle cap.
- Review pass and main thread disagree across two passes on the same item.

Reporting and stopping is success behavior, not failure. Substituting an
inappropriate tool to "keep going" is failure behavior.

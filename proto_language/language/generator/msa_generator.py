    This class defines configuration parameters for the MSA generator, which samples
    mutations from position-specific probability distributions derived from a multiple
    sequence alignment.

    Attributes:
        msa (MSA): Multiple sequence alignment containing homologous sequences.
            Accepts either an MSA object or a list of aligned sequences (same length).
            The alignment defines position-specific amino acid/nucleotide distributions.

        num_mutations (int): Number of positions to randomly mutate per sample.
            Positions are selected from non-gap columns and mutated according to
            the empirical distribution at that position. Automatically capped at
            the number of mutable positions. Must be at least 1. Default: 1.

        include_gaps (bool): Whether to include gap characters ('-') when computing
            position probability distributions:

            - ``False``: Gaps are excluded; probabilities are computed only from
              non-gap characters (default)
            - ``True``: Gaps are included in distributions; sampled mutations may
              introduce gaps

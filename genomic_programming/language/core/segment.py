    Building block for biological constructs with two sequence pools: candidate (work space) and selected (results space):

    Examples:
        Creating a Segment with a sequence:

        Creating a Segment with just a length:
        >>> variable_region = Segment(length=100, sequence_type=SequenceType.DNA, label="variable")
        >>> variable_region.sequence_length  # 100
        >>> variable_region.selected_sequences  # [Sequence("")]

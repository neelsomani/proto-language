class MCMCGenerator(IterativeGenerator):
    """
    Metropolis-Hastings MCMC generator for constraint-driven sequence optimization.

    This generator implements a Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm that uses
    multiple sub-generators as proposal distributions and constraints to define
    the energy function. It's designed for iterative sequence refinement where
    proposals are accepted or rejected based on energy improvements.

    The generator supports simulated annealing, multiple constraints with weights,
    and flexible sequence concatenation for complex multi-part designs.

    Examples:
        Basic MCMC optimization:

        ...     constraint_weights=[1.0, 2.0],  # Weight homopolymer constraint more
        ...     num_steps=100,
        ...     temperature=0.5,  # More greedy sampling
        ...     temperature_min=0.001

class ChainedGenerator:
    """
    Pipeline orchestrator that chains multiple IterativeGenerator stages in sequence.

    This meta-generator runs a series of independent IterativeGenerator objects (stages)
    in order, automatically propagating sequences between stages. Each stage can use
    different optimization strategies, constraints, and generators, enabling
    multi-stage design workflows.

    Examples:
        Creating a two-stage optimization pipeline:
        >>> from proto_language.generator import ChainedGenerator, MCMCGenerator, UniformMutationGenerator
        >>> from proto_language.constraint import gc_content_constraint
        >>> from proto_language.base import Construct, ConstructSegment
        >>> from proto_language.utils import SequenceType
        >>>
        >>> # Create segments and generators
        >>> segment1 = ConstructSegment(sequence="A" * 50, sequence_type=SequenceType.DNA)
        >>> segment2 = ConstructSegment(sequence="A" * 50, sequence_type=SequenceType.DNA)
        >>>
        >>> gen1 = UniformMutationGenerator(sequence_length=50, batch_size=3)
        >>> gen2 = UniformMutationGenerator(sequence_length=50, batch_size=3)
        >>> gen1.assign(segment1)
        >>> gen2.assign(segment2)
        >>>
        >>> # Stage 1: Increase GC content
        >>> construct1 = Construct([segment1])
        >>> constraint1 = Constraint(
        ...     inputs=[segment1],
        ...     scoring_function=gc_content_constraint,
        ...     scoring_function_config={"min_gc": 70.0, "max_gc": 90.0}

        ...     scoring_function_config={"min_gc": 80.0, "max_gc": 95.0}
        ... )

        ...     num_steps=50,
        ...     verbose=False
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> # Create and run the chained pipeline
        >>> pipeline = ChainedGenerator([stage1, stage2], verbose=True)
        >>> pipeline.run()
        >>>
        >>> # Get results
        >>> final_sequences = pipeline.get_final_sequences()
        >>> stage_results = pipeline.get_stage_results()
        >>> print(f"Generated {len(final_sequences)} sequences")
        >>> print(f"Stage 1 execution time: {stage_results[0]['execution_time']:.2f}s")

        Using different generator types per stage:
        >>> # Stage 1: Point mutations with MCMC
        >>> # Stage 2: Structure-based generation (if available)
        >>> # Stage 3: Final refinement with different constraints

        Accessing detailed metadata:
        >>> pipeline = ChainedGenerator([stage1, stage2])
        >>> pipeline.run()
        >>> metadata = pipeline.get_stage_metadata()
        >>> for stage_meta in metadata:

        ...     print(f"Execution time: {stage_meta['execution_summary']['execution_time']:.2f}s")

    Note:
        Unlike IterativeGenerator subclasses, ChainedGenerator is a pipeline orchestrator
        that manages the execution flow between multiple generators rather than generating
        sequences itself. It does not inherit from IterativeGenerator.

    Beam search generator that processes segments sequentially with context accumulation.
    
    This generator implements a sequential beam search where:
    1. Segments are processed one at a time, in order
    2. For each segment, the top K sequences accumulated from previous segments are used as prompts
    3. Generators are applied sequentially within each segment to generate num_candidates
    4. Constraints are evaluated on concatenated sequences after each segment
    5. Top K combinations are selected and used as prompts for the next segment
    
    **Key Features:**
    - Processes segments sequentially (not independently)
    - Accumulates context from previous segments as prompts
    - Applies constraints after each segment to guide optimization
    - Maintains beam search across segment boundaries
    - Freezes optimization of earlier segments as new segments are added
    
    **Important: Generator Batch Size Override**
    - Generator `batch_size` parameters are ignored during beam search
    - The `beam_width` parameter controls how many sequences are maintained (K)
    - The `num_candidates` parameter controls how many candidates are generated per beam (N)
    - Generators are applied to individual sequences, not batches

class SeqMotifConfig(BaseConfig):
    """Configuration for sequence motif constraint using MEME.
    
    This class defines configuration parameters for evaluating DNA sequences against
    known transcription factor binding motifs using MEME Suite's Find Individual
    Motif Occurrences tool. The constraint searches for position weight matrix
    motifs in sequences and can either encourage specific motifs (wanted) or discourage
    them (not_wanted), enabling design of sequences with controlled sites.
    
    Attributes:
        motifs_path (str): Path to MEME format motif file (.meme) containing position
            weight matrices. Must be a valid file path. MEME format files can
            be obtained from databases like JASPAR, TRANSFAC, or created with MEME
            Suite tools. Example: "/data/motifs/jaspar_vertebrates.meme" or
            "~/databases/tf_motifs.meme".

        meme_bin_path (str): Path to directory containing MEME Suite binaries. Must
            include the ``fimo`` executable. The directory should contain the full
            MEME Suite installation. Example: "/usr/local/meme/bin" or
            "/opt/meme-5.5.0/bin". Install MEME Suite from https://meme-suite.org/

        wanted (Optional[Union[str, List[str]]]): Motifs that should be present in
            sequences. Options:
            - "all": All motifs in the file must be present
            - "none" or None: No requirement for specific motifs
            - List of motif names: Specific motifs that should be present,
              e.g., ["SP1", "NF-kB", "lacO"]
            Strong matches to wanted motifs result in low penalties (rewards).
            Default: None.

        not_wanted (Optional[Union[str, List[str]]]): Motifs that should NOT be
            present in sequences. Options:
            - "all": No motifs should be present (avoid all binding sites)
            - "none" or None: Allow any motifs (default)
            - List of motif names: Specific motifs to avoid.
            Strong matches to unwanted motifs result in high penalties. Default: None.

        scale (float): Scaling factor to adjust penalty magnitude. Values >1 make
            the constraint stricter (larger penalties), values <1 make it more
            lenient (smaller penalties). For example, 2.0 doubles all penalties,
            0.5 halves them. Must be positive. Default: 1.0.

        exclusive (bool): If True, automatically sets unwanted motifs as the complement
            of wanted motifs (and vice versa). For example, if wanted=["SP1", "NF-kB"]
            and exclusive=True, all other motifs in the file become unwanted. Useful
            for enforcing strict motif specificity. Default: True.

        aggregation (Literal["smart", "average", "max", "percentile"]): Method for
            aggregating penalties across multiple motifs:
            - "smart": Adaptive strategy that uses max/percentile for unwanted motifs
              and average for wanted motifs (recommended for most cases)
            - "average": Simple average of all penalties (treats all motifs equally)
            - "max": Takes maximum penalty (strictest, most conservative)
            - "percentile": Uses specified percentile of penalties (see percentile_value)
            Default: "smart".

        percentile_value (float): Percentile to use when aggregation="percentile".
            For example, 95.0 combines the 95th percentile (top 5% worst penalties).
            Must be between 0.0 and 100.0. Higher values are more lenient (focus
            on worst offenders), lower values are stricter. Default: 95.0.

        unwanted_focus (bool): When both wanted and unwanted motifs are specified,
            whether to weight unwanted motifs more heavily in the final score. If True,
            unwanted motif penalties are given higher weight, making it harder to
            pass the constraint if unwanted motifs are present. Useful when avoiding
            specific binding sites is critical. Default: False.
    
    Note:
        Motif names must match exactly with the names in the MEME file (case-sensitive).
        Use the MOTIF lines in the .meme file to identify available motif names.

    """Score DNA sequences against sequence motifs using MEME.
    
    This constraint function uses MEME Suite's Find Individual Motif
    Occurrences tool to search for sequence  motifs represented as position weight matrices
    in DNA sequences. It evaluates whether sequences contain desired motifs (wanted)
    or unwanted motifs (not_wanted).
    
    The scoring strategy penalizes sequences based on motif presence:
    - **Unwanted motifs**: Strong matches (low E-values) result in high penalties,
      encouraging sequences without these binding sites
    - **Wanted motifs**: Strong matches result in low penalties (rewards), while
      missing wanted motifs result in high penalties
    - **No motif specification**: Any motif matches are penalized (novelty constraint)

    Args:
        sequences (List[Sequence]): List of DNA sequences to evaluate. Each sequence
            is independently scanned for motif occurrences using FIMO. Sequences can
            be any length, though motif detection accuracy improves with longer
            sequences (50+ bp recommended).

        config (SeqMotifConfig): Configuration object containing ``motifs_path``
            (MEME motif file), ``meme_bin_path`` (MEME Suite binary directory),
            ``wanted`` (default: None), ``not_wanted`` (default: None), ``aggregation``
            (default: "smart"), and other scoring parameters.

    Returns:
        List[float]: Penalty scores for each sequence, ranging from 0.0 (best,
            all motif criteria satisfied) to 1.0 (worst, severe violations). The
            scoring depends on wanted/unwanted configuration:
            - **Only unwanted specified**: 0.0 if no unwanted motifs found, higher
              scores for stronger unwanted matches
            - **Only wanted specified**: 0.0 if all wanted motifs found with strong
              E-values, 1.0 if wanted motifs missing
            - **Both specified**: Weighted combination based on aggregation method
    
    Note:
        This function modifies the input sequences by adding metadata to each
        ``Sequence`` object's ``_metadata`` dictionary with the following keys:
        
        - ``motif_constraint``: Dictionary containing:
          - ``penalty``: Float overall penalty score (0.0-1.0)
          - ``wanted``: Set of wanted motif names
          - ``not_wanted``: Set of unwanted motif names
          - ``found``: Dictionary mapping motif names to their best (lowest) E-values
          - ``details``: Dictionary with per-motif scoring details including:
            - ``penalty``: Individual motif penalty
            - ``status``: "wanted_found", "wanted_missing", "unwanted", or "unwanted_absent"
            - ``e_value``: E-value if motif was found
          - ``aggregation_info``: Dictionary with aggregation statistics:
            - ``method``: Aggregation method used
            - ``unwanted_count``: Number of unwanted motif evaluations
            - ``wanted_count``: Number of wanted motif evaluations
            - ``unwanted_matches``: Number of unwanted motifs found
            - ``wanted_matches``: Number of wanted motifs found

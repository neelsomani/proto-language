"""
Defines the base classes for the high-level programming language framework.

This module provides the core abstractions for sequence programming:
- ConstructSegment: Individual sequence variables with validation and metadata
- Construct: Fully-defined biological construct consisting of a collection of ConstructSegment objects
- Constraint: Scoring functions that evaluate sequence quality
- Generator: Base class for sequence generation algorithms
- IterativeGenerator: Specialized generator for iterative optimization

These classes work together to enable flexible, constraint-driven sequence design
using various generation strategies like MCMC, autoregressive models, etc.

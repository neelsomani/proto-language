A framework for designing biological sequences (DNA, RNA, proteins) with constraint-based optimization.

- [`proto-language-lang` (front end)](https://github.com/evo-design/proto-language-lang)

> [!NOTE]
> We currently in the process of transferring all of the tool implementations from the `proto-language` to the [`bio-tools`](https://github.com/evo-design/bio-tools/tree/main) repo. Installation instructions will change in the near future.


## Installation

Run the install script (it initializes git submodules and creates the conda environment):


```bash
bash install.sh
conda activate proto-language
```
>[!NOTE] The installation script is currently failing on Chimera due to dependency issues.
> For now, use the following to clone from Brian's env:

```bash
conda create --name proto-language --clone /home/brianhie/miniconda/envs/gpro/
pip uninstall -y numcodecs zarr
pip install --no-cache-dir --force-reinstall numcodecs zarr
pip install -e /home/{USERNAME}/proto-language
```


## Running the API

### Local Development

```bash
python api/start_dev.py
```

### Docker

```bash
docker-compose up
```

API will be available at http://localhost:8000

## Tests

Tests can be run with various filtering options based on hardware utilization and execution time.
See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for more details. A few commonly used commands are listed below.

- By default, slow tests *are skipped*. You must specify `--all` to run them.
- By default, we don't filter tests by hardware utilization. Specify `--cpu` to run only CPU-based tests and `--gpu` to run only GPU-based tests.

```bash
# Run all tests that are not marked as slow (both CPU and GPU based)
pytest

# Run all tests, including slow ones (both CPU and GPU based)
pytest --all

# Run fast CPU-based tests
pytest --cpu

# Run all GPU-based tests
pytest --gpu --all
```


## Running the Toy Example

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open and run `notebooks/toy_example.ipynb`

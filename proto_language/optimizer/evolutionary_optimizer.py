"""Evolutionary algorithm optimizer with population-based search, crossover, and selection.

Provides the ``evolutionary`` optimization strategy: a population-based algorithm that
maintains N candidate sequences across generations. Each generation produces offspring through
crossover (recombining parent sequences) and mutation (using the framework's existing mutation
generators), evaluates all offspring against the constraints, and selects survivors via
tournament selection with optional elitism. Unlike single-chain MCMC which explores one basin
at a time, the population maintains diversity across multiple promising regions simultaneously.

Examples:
    >>> from proto_language.constraint import gc_content_constraint
    >>> from proto_language.core import Constraint, Construct, Program, Segment
    >>> from proto_language.generator import RandomNucleotideGenerator, RandomNucleotideGeneratorConfig
    >>> from proto_language.optimizer import EvolutionaryOptimizer, EvolutionaryOptimizerConfig
    >>> seg = Segment(length=20, sequence_type="dna")
    >>> gen = RandomNucleotideGenerator(RandomNucleotideGeneratorConfig())
    >>> gen.assign(seg)
    >>> gc = Constraint(inputs=[seg], function=gc_content_constraint, function_config={"min_gc": 80, "max_gc": 90})
    >>> optimizer = EvolutionaryOptimizer(
    ...     constructs=[Construct([seg])],
    ...     generators=[gen],
    ...     constraints=[gc],
    ...     config=EvolutionaryOptimizerConfig(population_size=10, num_generations=20),

    """Configuration object for EvolutionaryOptimizer.

    This class defines configuration parameters for the evolutionary algorithm optimizer,
    which maintains a population of candidate sequences and evolves them through
    crossover, mutation, and selection over multiple generations.

    Attributes:
        population_size (int): Number of individuals in the population. Each individual
            is a candidate sequence that evolves across generations. Must be at least 2
            (minimum for crossover) and divisible by tournament_size for balanced
            tournaments. Overrides program-level ``num_results`` if set.

        num_generations (int): Number of evolutionary generations to run. Each generation
            produces offspring through crossover and mutation, evaluates them, and selects
            survivors. More generations allow better convergence but increase runtime.
            Must be at least 1.

        elitism_count (int): Number of best individuals (lowest energy) to carry unchanged
            into the next generation. Elitism ensures the best solution never regresses
            across generations. Must be non-negative and less than ``population_size``.
            Default: 1.

        tournament_size (int): Number of individuals competing in each tournament selection.
            Larger tournaments create stronger selection pressure (favor better individuals
            more heavily). Must be at least 2 and at most ``population_size``. Default: 3.

        crossover_rate (float): Probability of applying crossover to create an offspring.
            When crossover occurs, two parents are selected and their genetic material is
            combined. When crossover does not occur (1 - crossover_rate), a single parent
            is cloned. Must be in [0.0, 1.0]. Default: 0.8.

        mutation_rate (float): Probability of applying mutation to each offspring after
            crossover. Mutation uses the assigned generators to modify sequences. Must be
            in [0.0, 1.0]. Default: 0.2.

        crossover_strategy (Literal["single-point", "uniform"]): Strategy for combining
            parent sequences:
            - ``"single-point"``: Select one random position and swap segments before/after
            - ``"uniform"``: For each position, randomly choose which parent contributes
            Default: ``"single-point"``.

        verbose (bool): Whether to print detailed progress information including
            population statistics and diversity metrics at each generation. Default: ``False``.

        tracking_interval (int): Number of generations between progress snapshots.
        track_proposals (bool): Whether to record offspring sequences alongside population.

    Note:
        - ``population_size`` determines ``num_results`` (one result per population member)
        - Total evaluations per generation: ``population_size`` offspring created and scored
        - Best practice: ``elitism_count`` >= 1 to preserve best solutions

    """Evolutionary algorithm optimizer for population-based sequence optimization.

    This optimizer implements a genetic algorithm that maintains a population of candidate
    sequences and evolves them over generations through crossover (recombination), mutation
    (using framework generators), and tournament selection. Unlike MCMC which follows a single
    trajectory, the EA maintains population diversity and explores multiple promising regions
    simultaneously.

    Each generation:
    1. Selects elite individuals (best ``elitism_count`` by energy) to survive unchanged
    2. Fills remaining population through tournament selection and genetic operators:
       - Select parents via tournament (``tournament_size`` individuals compete)
       - Apply crossover with probability ``crossover_rate`` to combine two parents
       - Apply mutation with probability ``mutation_rate`` using assigned generators
    3. Evaluates all offspring against constraints
    4. Forms next generation from elites + selected offspring

    Attributes:
        population_size: Number of individuals in the population.
        num_generations: Total generations to evolve.
        elitism_count: Best individuals preserved unchanged per generation.
        tournament_size: Individuals competing in each tournament.
        crossover_rate: Probability of crossover operation.
        mutation_rate: Probability of mutation operation.
        crossover_strategy: Method for recombining parents ("single-point" or "uniform").
        selection: Survivor selection method ("tournament" or "nsga2").

    Example:
        >>> config = EvolutionaryOptimizerConfig(population_size=20, num_generations=50, elitism_count=2)
        >>> optimizer = EvolutionaryOptimizer(
        ...     constructs=constructs, generators=[mutation_gen], constraints=[gc_constraint], config=config
        ... )
        >>> optimizer.run()
        >>> best_sequence = optimizer.constructs[0].segments[0].result_sequences[0]

    Note:
        - Crossover requires sequences of the same length across all segments
        - Mutation reuses framework generators (no new mutation primitive needed)
        - Tournament selection: randomly sample ``tournament_size`` individuals, pick best
        - Elitism guarantees monotonic improvement of the best individual's energy

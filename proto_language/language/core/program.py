class Program:
    """Programs represent user-defined biological designs.

    This class supports sequential execution of multiple optimizers, where each
    optimizer builds on the results of the previous one. All optimizers must
    share the same construct objects to ensure state persistence.

    Optimizer Handoff Contract:
        When running multiple optimizers sequentially, the Program ensures proper
        state transfer between stages:

        **After each optimizer completes:**

        Optimizers are responsible for their own sorting. Rejection Sampling keeps
        ``result_sequences`` sorted by energy throughout its run. Other
        optimizers' natural ordering is preserved as-is.

        **Before the next optimizer runs:**

        1. ``_initialize_sequence_pools()`` reads from ``result_sequences``
           (or ``original_sequence`` if first optimizer)
        2. Both ``result_sequences`` and ``proposal_sequences`` are initialized by
           cycling through source to preserve diversity when pool sizes differ
           (e.g., source=[A,B,C], num_results=5 -> [A,B,C,A,B])

        **Optimizer-specific behavior:**

        - **Rejection Sampling**: Clears ``result_sequences`` and repopulates dynamically
          during run (always sorted by energy)
        - **MCMC**: Uses ``result_sequences`` as parallel trajectories, overwrites
          ``proposal_sequences`` each step via ``_populate_proposal_sequences()``
        - **CyclingOptimizer**: Works directly on ``proposal_sequences``
        - **BeamSearch**: Ignores previous state entirely, starts fresh from configured prompt

    Examples:
        Sequential optimization with Rejection Sampling followed by MCMC:

        ...     RejectionSamplingOptimizer,

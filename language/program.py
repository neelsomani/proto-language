class Program:
    """
    Programs represent user-defined biological designs.

    This class is a user-friendly wrapper around iterative generators like MCMC and
    Sequential generators. It provides a simplified interface for setting up and
    running sequence optimization workflows with constructs, generators, and constraints.

    Examples:
        Basic MCMC optimization program:
        >>> from language.generator import MCMCGenerator
        >>> program = Program(
        ...     iterative_generator_type=MCMCGenerator,
        ...     constructs=[construct1, construct2],
        ...     generators=[evo2_gen, mutation_gen],
        ...     constraints=[gc_constraint, length_constraint],
        ...     constraint_weights=[1.0, 0.5],
        ...     num_steps=100,
        ...     temperature=1.0,
        ...     temperature_min=0.001
        ... )
        >>> history = program.run()  # Execute optimization
        >>> final_sequences = program.constructs

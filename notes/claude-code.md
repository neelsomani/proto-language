# Using Claude Code with This Repo

This guide covers the Claude Code tooling available in `proto-language` and `proto-tools`. Both repos have custom commands, skills, and CI integrations that make common workflows faster.

## What's Available

### Skills

Skills are domain knowledge that Claude loads on demand. You don't invoke them directly; Claude activates them when working on relevant tasks.

**proto-language:**

| Skill | When It Activates |
|-------|------------------|
| `general-dev` | Architecture overview, coding conventions, Pydantic config patterns |
| `implement-constraint` | Implementing, modifying, or debugging constraints in the DSL |
| `implement-generator` | Implementing, modifying, or debugging generators |
| `implement-optimizer` | Implementing, modifying, or debugging optimizers |
| `testing` | Writing tests: pytest markers, fixtures, CPU/GPU patterns |
| `write-program` | Composing optimization programs (Segments, Constructs, Programs) |

**proto-tools:**

| Skill | When It Activates |
|-------|------------------|
| `implement-tool` | Implementing a new bioinformatics tool wrapper (6-phase parallelized pipeline) |
| `fix-env` | Debugging tool environment setup failures (compute detection, env isolation, deps) |

### CI Integration

| Trigger | What Happens |
|---------|-------------|
| `@claude` in a PR comment | Claude reviews the PR or answers a specific question |
| `@claude` in an issue body/title | Claude responds when the issue is opened or assigned |

## Common Workflows

### Fix a GitHub issue

To fix a GitHub issue, describe the issue to Claude (e.g., "fix issue #42"). Claude will investigate the codebase, write a failing test, implement the fix, and create a PR.

### Implement a new component

For constraints, generators, or optimizers, just describe what you want. Claude will activate the relevant skill automatically and follow the established patterns (registry decorator, Pydantic models, test templates).

Example prompts:
- "Implement a new constraint that checks codon usage bias"
- "Add a generator that wraps the ProGen3 model"

### Implement a new tool (proto-tools)

The `implement-tool` skill runs a 6-phase parallelized pipeline: research → contract → scaffolding → implementation → testing → integration. Describe the tool and point Claude at the paper or model docs.

### Get a PR reviewed

In any PR, comment:
```
@claude
```
Claude will do a full code review. Or ask a specific question:
```
@claude why does this function use caching instead of recomputing?
```

## How the Pieces Fit Together

```
CLAUDE.md          → Conventions Claude always follows (coding style, architecture, commands)
.claude/skills/    → Domain knowledge loaded on demand (how to implement a constraint, etc.)
.claude/commands/  → Multi-step workflows you invoke explicitly
notes/             → Human documentation (this file, dev.md, batching.md)
```

- **CLAUDE.md** is the first thing Claude reads. It contains architecture, coding conventions, and key commands. Both repos have their own.
- **Skills** are reference material Claude consults when doing specific tasks. They contain templates, patterns, and decision trees.
- **Commands** are step-by-step workflows. They're the "do this task end-to-end" instructions.
- **notes/** is human documentation. `dev.md` covers git workflows, CI, and the export chain validator. This file covers the Claude Code layer on top of that.

## Tips

- **Sub-agent parallelism**: Claude can fan out investigation to multiple sub-agents. When giving Claude complex tasks, it will parallelize where possible.
- **Worktrees**: Claude creates worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/` for isolated work. You can have multiple issues in-flight simultaneously without branch switching. Clean up with `git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/<name>`.
- **Submodule in worktrees**: Worktrees don't auto-initialize submodules. If your fix touches `proto-tools` code, run `git submodule update --init --recursive` inside the worktree before running tests.
- **Auto-memory**: Claude maintains personal notes across sessions in `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/`. This is per-developer and not committed. It's where Claude remembers debugging patterns and project quirks.
- **Squash merge**: Always use squash merge for PRs in `evo-design/*` repos.
